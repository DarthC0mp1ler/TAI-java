## K nearest neighbours algorithm
  Using iris data it specifies the k nearest neighbours provided by user to the input iris data and classifis it to either spiece of irises. It uses euclidian distance.

## Perceptron delta learning algorithm
  There is one perceptron that trains on iris training data set to classify iris-setosa from other two spieces.

## Bayessian Classification algorithm
  This algorithm classifies calculating probability to which spiece the input iris belongs to and then displays the confusion matrix and calculates performance measures (Accuracy, Precision, Recall And F-measure).

## K elements clustering algorithm
  This algorithm separates the given data set in a k different groups. Number K is provided by the user. And the content of each cluster is displayed after each step of calculation. The entropy of those clusters are displayed at the end of computation.
